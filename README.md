# SCM Practice - Nguyen

## Software Configuration Management (SCM)

SCM stands for Software Configuration Management. It’s basically is process to systematically manage, organize, control change in the documents, code during the Development Life Cycle. With SCM, you can see what was changed, who changed it, and why. 

## How GitHub Helps

GitHub makes using SCM way easier. It lets you store your code online, track your progress, and collaborate with others. 
+ One of the best parts is that it lets several people (or even whole teams) work on the same project at the same time without stepping on each other's toes. 
+ We can create branches to test out new features, make commits to save your changes, and merge everything back together when it’s ready. 
+ It also helps you go back to earlier versions if something breaks. Overall, GitHub is a great tool for managing code and working with others.
